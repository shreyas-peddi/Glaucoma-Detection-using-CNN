# Glaucoma-Detection-using-CNN
We have used Python as the main programming language for our experiment and we have used various cnn architectures such as DenseNet ,ResNet ,MobileNet to detect glaucoma from the given images we have used a dataset of 130 images to train our model and have done 25 epochs which have 25 steps each to train the models which are to be used to detect glaucoma and we have used adam from keras library to optimize our model to perform efficiently.And then we have used seaborn and matplot library to plot graphs so that we could understand the efficiency of our programs.
